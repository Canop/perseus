# Examples

This folder contains examples for Perseus, which are used to test the project and are excellent learning resources! If any of these don't work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/issues/choose) to let us know!

These examples are all fully self-contained, and do not serve as examples in the traditional Cargo way, they are each indepedent crates to enable the use of build tools such as `wasm-pack`.

-   Showcase -- an app that demonstrates all the different features of Perseus, including SSR, SSG, and ISR (this example is actively used for testing/development)
-   Basic -- a simple app that uses the Perseus CLI (symlinks to CLI example)
-   CLI -- same as basic, but includes the CLI subcrates (actively used for testing/development)
-   i18n -- a simple app that showcases internationalization in particular
