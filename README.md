# Perseus

> ðŸš§ Perseus is still under active development! Please use it with caution at this early stage! ðŸš§

Perseus is a frontend web development library for Rust with full support for SSR, SSG, and ISR. It wraps the excellent lower-level systems of [Sycamore](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore), adding a more familiar NextJS-like API for SSR/SSG while maintaining maximum customizability.
