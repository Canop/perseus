> ðŸš§ Perseus is **nearly** ready for v0.1.0, but is still under construction! ðŸš§

Perseus is a blazingly fast frontend web development framework built in Rust with support for major rendering strategies, reactivity without a virtual DOM, and extreme customizability. It wraps the lower-level capabilities of [Sycamore](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore) and provides a NextJS-like API!

- âœ¨ Supports static generation (serving only static resources)
- âœ¨ Supports server-side rendering (serving dynamic resources)
- âœ¨ Supports revalidation after time and/or with custom logic (updating rendered pages)
- âœ¨ Supports incremental regeneration (build on demand)
- âœ¨ Open build matrix (use any rendering strategy with anything else, mostly)

## How to use

Check out the docs [here](https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus) (WORK IN PROGRESS!) for how to use Perseus.

## Aim

Support every major rendering strategy and provide developers the ability to efficiently create super-fast apps with Rust and a fantastic developer experience!

## Motivation

There is a sore lack of Rust frameworks for frontend development that support more than just SPAs and client-side rendering, and so Perseus was born. We need something like NextJS for WASM.

## Roadmap

### Pre-beta

These tasks still need to be done before Perseus can be pushed to v0.1.0.

- [ ] Support providing request data to SSR renderers

### Pre-stable

These tasks still need to be done before Perseus can be pushed to v1.0.0.

- [ ] Support custom template hierarchies
- [ ] Create a custom CLI as a harness for apps without riediculous amounts of configuration needed
- [ ] Support i18n out of the box
- [ ] (Maybe) Implement custom router
- [ ] Pre-built integrations for Actix Web and AWS Lambda

### Beyond

These tasks will be done after Perseus is stable.

- [ ] Integrations for other platforms
