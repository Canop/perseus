# Building Your First App

This section is a tutorial on building your first app with Perseus! This will cover the basic usage of the Perseus CLI to build/serve your app, the setup of a routing system, and the creation of basic templates by teaching you by example how to create a simple site with an index page and an about page.

If learning by reading isn't really your thing, or you'd like a reference, you can see all the code in the `basic` example [here](https://github.com/arctic-hen7/perseus/tree/main/examples/basic).
