> ðŸš§ This book is nearly complete, but Perseus is not yet in beta yet, so you can't install it as a library or use it yet! We're working on it, and it'll be ready very soon, we promise! ðŸš§

Welcome to the Perseus documentation! Here, you'll find guides on how to use Perseus, as well as documentation for specific features and plenty of examples!
