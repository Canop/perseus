# Styling

Perseus uses [Sycamore](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore) for writing views, and styling is still [in development](https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/docs/v0.6/advanced/css) there.

*Note: a blog post will be released soon on setting up TailwindCSS with Perseus if you're interested in that.*
