# Website

> Note: the website is still under active development, and has not yet been deployed

This directory contains the website for Perseus, which is hosted at <https://arctic-hen7.github.io/perseus>!

TODO

## Why is this in `website/website`?

So that using the local version of Perseus rather than the most recently published release works without any further changes. In development, this is designed to work for the `examples/` directory, using `../../` to access `packages`. We mimic the same file structure here.
