## Reporting a Vulnerability

if you've found a vulnerability in Perseus, please email the lead maintainer or the project privately at [arctic_hen7@pm.me](mailto:arctic_hen7@pm.me). Do NOT open a public issue on this repository.

Your report should be reponded to within the week, and follow-up information will be given. If the report is not a significant or exploitable vulnerability, it will be opened as an issue, and otherwise it will be dealt with privately until it's fixed. Then, affected versions will be yanked (meaning they can no longer be downloaded, but are still indexed), and an advisory will be publicly released.
